                                                                 HAPPY HOSPITALITY

A hotel management system(HMS) brings together all the elements of running a successful hotel from booking and check-in, to room assignment and billing, to a plethora of other hospitality functions. PMS has never been as important as it is today. This is because of the technological transformation our world has been going through the past several years. Now, the world is smaller than ever before. This in turn means guests have different demands and expectations than previous generations.


Why choose a Hotel Management System as a project?
In the hospitality industry, there are a large quantity of HMS systems to help property managers maintain successful operations. Selecting one can be a daunting task. It all depends on the size of your hotel and the budget you have put aside for a HMS.

The Marriott utilizes ‘’Opera’’, which is the industry standard for property management software. With that of course, comes a higher price that most small to medium size hotels can't afford. Some hotel chains spend money to develop their own software, as Hilton did with their ‘’OnQ’’ HMS. Only large scale hotel chains have the spending power to invest in expensive and well built systems which have a good return on investment.

The small scale and medium size properties do not even dare to think of implementing a hotel management system due to the costs. This motivated us to create a different approach to the existing system.


How is our HMS different?
Conventional HMS’ that cater to large chains only focus on the in-house services of that chain. Companies that control the interface between the consumer and the provider of the goods or services are in an incredibly valuable position. They carry none of the costs of providing the service but take a cut from the millions of consumers that buy from them(like Uber, Doordash etc).

Our HMS focuses to cater  for SMEs that do not have inhouse services/employees. Unlike conventional hotels, our system will help property owners to outsource services like restaurants, laundry in the city. Our HMS allows service providers to make profits from the many small and medium hotels that make up 80% of the hotel industry.This is a win-win situation for the hotel and the services.
